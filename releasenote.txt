Info on Assignment I completed :
- Level 1 done all functionalities

- Level 2 is done . I can display all guide channel tv with airing time , responsive with current user device timezone and limit to 7 day after. For pagination not sure on the parameter for the endpoint (no params in the endpoint for page=2 etc), bcs no pagination I didnâ€™t use lazy load concept (I could use it in willdisplay cell on each last row).

- Level 3 only sort by favorite and create class for User Profile. Google login and FB need configure their SDK and dashboard with proper key, also for cloud based, AWS I dont have free tier in my account, and either it or firebase or other sdk need more time to configure it. Logout basically just clear cache from db I use cloud and in-app database.
For prompt to login , logic just check have user or not in root controller, if not present modally the controller of login controller

- Focusing on how do I modeling the project and implement MVVM with RxSwift and SOLID principle for each object

- I documented each function clearly with proper comment above the class / function / protocol
